The Avengers Tower GBC marries a minimally-modified 76038 Attack on Avengers Tower set from 2015 with the Brickworld 2018 Ball Pump.
<P>
The tower structure has been "hollowed out" to allow for the ball pump tube to rise through the front half of the set, while the rear hinged-section of the set has been reversed to swing open from the opposite side, to be viewable when open, from the front of a GBC display.
<p>
The ball pump input has been lengthened slightly to provide more space for ball entry when the tower sections are closed.
